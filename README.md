# Blogging-PHP-Site
This is a project I made by myself using more advanced knowledge of PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL and JQuery. 
This blogging website allows a user to register a user name, avatar then login using their username and a password.
Once logged in they can create a post and their post will be added to a section titled their name's blogs. The
user can also read other users' blogs.
